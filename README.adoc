= Technologies of "Attack Surface" by Cory Doctorow

I have read this book recently (of course, after reading the previous two, 
"Little Brother" and "Homeland") and noticed that I am not very familiar with 
some technologies mentioned in the book. 
So I googled and learned about them and decided to collect the links
and short descriptions here in this repo. 

Feel free to fork and edit/expand this document and then open a PR. 
I appreciate all feedback and help.

The document is written in Asciidoc (it's very similar to Markdown, but better ;-) ).
