According to Alec Muffett “Facebook’s onion address provides a way to access Facebook through Tor without losing the cryptographic protections provided by the Tor cloud. … it provides end-to-end communication, from your browser directly into a Facebook datacentre.” The address is facebookcorewwwi.onion where .onion is the common top-level domain name for sites in Tor network.

Its purpose is to load the operating system (hence the name).

The main feature of it is that you update it very often to make sure all known vulnerabilities are patched or at least there are no known exploits for them. Masha explains that you should always check the OS signatures to make sure you are actually installing the correct bits and not something created by the government hackers containing backdoors and loggers. Apparently there is such a project in real life, but it`’s not specifically focused on security – it just uses the cool name.

That way it will be able to collect all information about the connected phones such as IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity), etc. Also it will be able to intercept phones’ traffic, voice and data using “man-in-the-middle” attack.
