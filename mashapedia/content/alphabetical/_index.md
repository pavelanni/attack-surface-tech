All technologies mentioned in "Attack Surface" sorted alphabetically for quick reference.

## A

An advanced persistent threat (`APT`) is a stealthy threat actor,
typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access
to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.

A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable
access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example,
to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.
Rootkits exist for different operating systems, including Android.
Masha just discovered a rootkit on Tanisha's phone.

### **Bootloader**

A piece of software which normally starts at the early stages of computer start-up process,
after executing the `BIOS`, but *before* the operating system starts.
Its purpose is to *load* the operating system (hence the name).
Bootloader integrity check is important to avoid a "boot attack":
type of attack that replaces the original bootloader and installs a bootloader
that can intercept passwords, including those used for hard drive encryption.

### **Caller ID spoofing**

A method or tool that allows the caller to pretend that the call is coming from a different number.
Masha uses it to read friends' voicemails pretending she is calling from *their* numbers.
Scammers use this method to pretend they are calling from the same area code -- that way
there is more chances that you pick the call.
Sometimes scammers even pretend they are calling from the *actual* 800-number which belongs to `IRS`.

---

### **Catching password from key sounds**

of you typing in your password can be used to guess it. That's why Masha does ""medium-loud AAAAAH""
when typing her password.

---

### **Enigmail**

In the email header from Kriztina there is a phrase:
+
----
Enigmail UNTRUSTED good signature from Kriztina <kriztinak@riseup.net>
----
+
That means she uses *Enigmail* to encrypt and digitally sign her messages.
Enigmail works with several mail clients including Thunderbird and Evolution.
The meaning of "Untrusted good signature" was explained on the Enigmail forum:
+
----
GOOD means that Enigmail verified that the mail content matches the
signature. Nobody tampered with the message. It reached you unmodified
and only the ones that have the SECRET key it is signed with are able
to perform that particular signature.
UNTRUSTED means that although the message matches the signature, GnuPG
cannot check whether the key belongs to the OWNER of the email address.

### **Everything after the slash**

Masha says: "I itched to get their Google searches, but that was hard because
Google had better security than every other service they visited -- strong `SSL`
certificates that hid everything after the slash,
so all I could see from my vantage point was `https://google.com/` -- and then...
nothing."
+
This happens when you visit sites that use `HTTPS` (secure `HTTP`) and hence,
use `SSL`/`TLS` certificates.
Even if somebody (in this case Masha) intercepts the traffic between you and
your provider, they will see only the domain name of the server you are accessing.
Everything else in your `URL` (search queries, usernames, etc.) will be hidden.

### **Facebook Tor Hidden Service**

A site that allows access to Facebook through the Tor protocol.
According to Alec Muffett "Facebook's onion address provides a way to access Facebook through Tor
without losing the cryptographic protections provided by the Tor cloud. ...
it provides end-to-end communication, from your browser directly into a Facebook datacentre."
The address is `facebookcorewwwi.onion` where `.onion` is the common top-level domain name
for sites in Tor network. You can enter this domain name in the Tor Browser's address field.
It won't work in your normal (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) browser. More:

### **Garbage in, garbage out (`GIGO`)**

This phrase was first used in November 1957 and is still quite popular among programmers

### **`IMSI`-catcher**

A device that can *pretend* to be a cell phone base station and make all phones in the nearest proximity
to connect to it (because its signal stronger than the real cell towers that are farther away).
That way it will be able to collect all information about the connected phones such as `IMSI`
(international mobile subscriber identity), etc. Also it will be able to intercept phones' traffic,
voice and data using "man-in-the-middle" attack.
Devices can be purchased online, as well as anti-`IMSI`-catchers.
You can build one yourself, if you want (see the link below).

### **`MAC` address**

Masha automatically corrects her boss when she says: "`max address`".
`MAC` stands for "`media access control`" and `MAC` address means the low-level
address assigned to a network card.
Sometimes `MAC` address is called "`physical address`" or "`hardware address`".
Usually it is represented as a series of hexadecimal numbers separated by
colons, like this: `00:0a:95:9d:68:16`.
Usually `MAC` address identifies a physical device (computer or phone)
pretty well (as opposed to `IP` address that could be different in different networks).
`MAC` address can be changed by the `OS`, but that only stays until the next reboot.

### **Paranoid Android**

In the book it seems to be the Android-based `OS` for smartphones focused on security.
The main feature of it is that you update it very often to make sure all known
vulnerabilities are patched or at least there are no known exploits for them.
Masha explains that you should always check the `OS` signatures to make sure
you are actually installing the correct bits and not something created by
the government hackers containing backdoors and loggers.
Apparently there is such a project in real life, but it's not specifically
focused on security -- it just uses the cool name.

### **`RPG`**

*Not* a Role-Playing Game (here).
A rocket-propelled grenade (often abbreviated `RPG`) is a shoulder-fired missile
weapon that launches rockets equipped with an explosive warhead.
Fun fact:
The term "rocket-propelled grenade" is a backronym; it stems from the Russian
language РПГ which stands for ручной противотанковый гранатомёт (transliterated as
"ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot", which has the initials "`RPG`"), meaning
"handheld anti-tank grenade launcher", the name given to early Russian designs.
Typical range is around several hundred meters.

post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt–shift lens)
normally required when the effect is produced optically.
