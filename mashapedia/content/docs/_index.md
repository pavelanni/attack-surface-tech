Welcome to the Mashapedia - a comprehensive glossary of technologies mentioned in Cory Doctorow's _Attack Surface_.

## How to Use This Guide

This documentation is organized in two ways:

1. **[Chapter by Chapter](/docs/chapters)** - Follow along with the book and discover technologies as they appear in each chapter
2. **[Alphabetical Reference](/alphabetical)** - Quick lookup for any specific term

## About the Book

_Attack Surface_ is the third book in Cory Doctorow's _Little Brother_ series. It follows Masha Maximow,
a tech specialist who worked for private military contractors and intelligence agencies,
as she grapples with the moral implications of surveillance technology and decides to use
her skills to fight back against authoritarian systems.

The book is packed with real-world technology references, from Tor and Signal to IMSI-catchers and adversarial perturbation.
This glossary aims to help readers understand these technologies better.
