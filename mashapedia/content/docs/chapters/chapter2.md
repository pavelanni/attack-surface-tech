A method or tool that allows the caller to pretend that the call is coming from a different number.

Scammers use this method to pretend they are calling from the same area code -- that way
there is more chances that you pick the call. 
Sometimes scammers even pretend they are calling from the *actual* 800-number which belongs to IRS.
