## Chapter 6

Plausible deniability

Plausible deniability is the ability of people, typically senior officials in a formal or 
informal chain of command, to deny knowledge of or responsibility for any damnable actions 
committed by others in an organizational hierarchy because of a lack or absence of evidence 
that can confirm their participation, even if they were personally involved in or at least 
willfully ignorant of the actions. If illegal or otherwise-disreputable and unpopular 
activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any awareness of such acts to 
insulate themselves and shift the blame onto the agents who carried out the acts, as they are
confident that their doubters will be unable to prove otherwise. The lack of evidence to the 
contrary ostensibly makes the denial plausible (credible), but sometimes, it makes the denial 
only unactionable.

Bad spelling in check-in messages

Obviously Masha still uses an old, centralized version control system 
like *Subversion*, and not more modern, decentralized Git.

ParanoidLinux

There is a project with this name (https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxparanoid/)
but it doesn't seem to be active.
Most likely what Masha means by ParanoidLinux is Tails (https://boingboing.net/2019/12/16/paranoid-linux-for-real.html).
