### Plausible deniability

Plausible deniability is the ability of people, typically senior officials in a formal or
informal chain of command, to deny knowledge of or responsibility for any damnable actions
committed by others in an organizational hierarchy because of a lack or absence of evidence
that can confirm their participation, even if they were personally involved in or at least
willfully ignorant of the actions. If illegal or otherwise-disreputable and unpopular
activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any awareness of such acts to
insulate themselves and shift the blame onto the agents who carried out the acts, as they are
confident that their doubters will be unable to prove otherwise. The lack of evidence to the
contrary ostensibly makes the denial plausible (credible), but sometimes, it makes the denial
only unactionable.

### ParanoidLinux

There is a project with this name (https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxparanoid/)
but it doesn't seem to be active.
Most likely what Masha means by ParanoidLinux is Tails (https://boingboing.net/2019/12/16/paranoid-linux-for-real.html).
