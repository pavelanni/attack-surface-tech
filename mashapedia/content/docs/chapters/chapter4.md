### RPG

*Not* a Role-Playing Game (here).
A rocket-propelled grenade (often abbreviated RPG) is a shoulder-fired missile
weapon that launches rockets equipped with an explosive warhead.
Fun fact:
The term "rocket-propelled grenade" is a backronym; it stems from the Russian
language РПГ which stands for ручной противотанковый гранатомёт (transliterated as
"ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot", which has the initials "RPG"), meaning
"handheld anti-tank grenade launcher", the name given to early Russian designs.
Typical range is around several hundred meters.

### Everything after the slash

Masha says: "I itched to get their Google searches, but that was hard because
Google had better security than every other service they visited -- strong SSL
certificates that hid everything after the slash,
so all I could see from my vantage point was https://google.com/ -- and then...
nothing."

This happens when you visit sites that use HTTPS (secure HTTP) and hence,
use SSL/TLS certificates.
Even if somebody (in this case Masha) intercepts the traffic between you and
your provider, they will see only the domain name of the server you are accessing.
Everything else in your URL (search queries, usernames, etc.) will be hidden.

### MAC address

Masha automatically corrects her boss when she says: "max address".
MAC stands for "media access control" and MAC address means the low-level
address assigned to a network card.
Sometimes MAC address is called "physical address" or "hardware address".
Usually it is represented as a series of hexadecimal numbers separated by
colons, like this: `00:0a:95:9d:68:16`.
Usually MAC address identifies a physical device (computer or phone)
pretty well (as opposed to IP address that could be different in different networks).
MAC address can be changed by the OS, but that only stays until the next reboot.
