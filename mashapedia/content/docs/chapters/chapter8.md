### 
Enigmail

In the email header from Kriztina there is a phrase:
+
----
Enigmail UNTRUSTED good signature from Kriztina <kriztinak@riseup.net>
----
+
That means she uses *Enigmail* to encrypt and digitally sign her messages.
Enigmail works with several mail clients including Thunderbird and Evolution.
The meaning of "Untrusted good signature" was explained on the Enigmail forum:
+
----
GOOD means that Enigmail verified that the mail content matches the
signature. Nobody tampered with the message. It reached you unmodified
and only the ones that have the SECRET key it is signed with are able
to perform that particular signature.
UNTRUSTED means that although the message matches the signature, GnuPG
cannot check whether the key belongs to the OWNER of the email address.
