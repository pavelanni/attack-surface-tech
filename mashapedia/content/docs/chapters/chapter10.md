## Chapter 10

Technical debt

Masha calls it "`technology debt`", but "`technical debt`" is more common.
Masha explains it pretty well: sometimes you create a solution to quickly
achieve your short-term goals, but in the long run this solution keeps
you from doing it the "`right way`".
The longer you postpone re-doing it properly, the bigger it grows and 
the harder it is to "`pay off`" your technical debt.
