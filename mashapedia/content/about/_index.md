## The Project

This project is a comprehensive glossary of technologies mentioned in Cory Doctorow's book _Attack Surface_.
When reading the book, I was amazed by the amount of tech terms Doctorow was using throughout the story.
While some terms like "Tor" might be familiar to tech-savvy readers, others like "IMSI-catcher"
or "adversarial perturbation" might require further explanation.

This collection aims to help readers understand these technologies better by providing:

- Clear, concise explanations
- Links to authoritative sources (primarily Wikipedia)
- Additional resources for deeper learning
- Context about how each technology relates to the story

## The Book

_Attack Surface_ is the third book in Cory Doctorow's _Little Brother_ series.
It follows Masha Maximow, a tech specialist who has worked for private military contractors and intelligence agencies.
The book explores themes of:

- Digital surveillance and privacy
- The ethics of technology in warfare
- Resistance against authoritarian systems
- The power and responsibility that comes with technical knowledge

## The Author

Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist, and journalist. He is a co-editor of the blog Boing Boing and has been named one of the Web's twenty-five influencers by Forbes Magazine and a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
